# Django: Pitcoin explorer

A barebones Django app, which can easily be deployed to Heroku.

## Running Locally

Make sure you have Python 3.7 [installed locally](http://install.python-guide.org). To push to Heroku, you'll need to install the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli), as well as [Postgres](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql#local-setup).

```
$ pip3 install -r requirments.txt
$ python3 manage.py runserver
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/).
